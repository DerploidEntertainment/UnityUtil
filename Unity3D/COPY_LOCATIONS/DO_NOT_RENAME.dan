Empty directories cannot be committed in Git.
When Git repositories are cloned, the directories are created on the fly as they are needed by files being unpacked by the object store.
Thus, an empty directory must have something in it to be committed, even just an empty file.

So, for the sake of version control:
    DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
    DO NOT RENAME THIS FILE
    DO NOT MOVE THIS FILE
