![Serilog.Enrichers.Unity](../../docs-assets/serilog-enrichers.png)

**Work in progress!**

This repo has been under open-source development since ~2017, but only since late 2022 has it been seriously considered for "usability" by 3rd parties,
so documentation content/organization are still in development.

## Overview

A [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) enricher to dynamically add Unity data to your log events like frame counts, GameObject hierarchies, etc.
