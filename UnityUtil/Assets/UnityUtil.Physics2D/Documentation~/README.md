# UnityUtil.Physics2D

[< Back to main README](../../../../README.md)

**Work in progress!**

This repo has been under open-source development since ~2017, but only since late 2022 has it been seriously considered for "usability" by 3rd parties,
so documentation content/organization are still in development.

## Overview

A set of utility classes and components useful to any 2D Unity project, specifically related to physics.
